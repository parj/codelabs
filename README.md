## How to build and use

```sh
# To build
docker build -t codelabs
# To serve
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 --rm web
```
Open your browser and head to http://localhost:8000 and as part of the build, you can see an example bundled in.

> **Note:**
> Gulp by default serves on `127.0.0.1` which is not exposed outside the container. In the [opts.js](opts.js), overriden the host to enable binding to `0.0.0.0` and therefore its exposed.
